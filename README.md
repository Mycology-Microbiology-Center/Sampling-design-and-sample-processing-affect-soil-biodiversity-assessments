# Sampling design and sample processing affect soil biodiversity assessments
This repository contains the code and resources used for analyzing the impact of sampling design on soil animal, bacterial, and fungal diversity estimates based on PacBio and Illumina amplicon sequencing. This repository eexplores the influences of sampling designs including sampling depth, sampling area, and sample size on the biodiversity estimation using individual samples, DNA and soil pooling samples. 
# Repository Contents
